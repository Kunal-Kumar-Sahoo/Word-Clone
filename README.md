# Word-Clone
This is a Python3 based GUI project where I have tried to replicate the looks and working of Microsoft Word or Google Docs using the technology PyQt5.

To install the necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(NOTE: MacOS and Linux users replace pip with pip3)
Suggestion: Use virtual environments so that your existing projects do not get compromised due to dependencies installed.

If any bugs or issues discovered feel free to contact me at

or Raise an issue on my github repo

Any kind of suggestions are welcome :)
